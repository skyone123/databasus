              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>GDPR</strong> (General Data Protection Regulation) -

              <p>
                Rybbit.io is designed to be privacy-compliant by default,

                We do <strong>not use cookies</strong> for tracking or analytics

                need for cookie consent banners and respecting your browser

              </p>

              <h2 id="data-storage">Data storage</h2>

              <p>
                All analytics data is stored on <strong>our own server</strong>.
                We maintain full control over the data and infrastructure,
                ensuring:

              <ul>
                <li>Data remains under our direct control</li>

                <li>
                  Data is stored securely with industry-standard practices

                <li>
                  Analytics data is retained only as long as necessary for

                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Because all data is anonymous and aggregated, there is no risk

                Everything above describes our website. The self-hosted
                Databasus app also collects a small amount of{" "}
                <strong>anonymous telemetry</strong> so we can see how Databasus
                is used in practice. It is intentionally minimal, cannot be tied
                back to you, your data or your instance and can be switched off
                at any time.

              <p>
                We collect only general, high-level metrics about key features
                — for example which database types and versions are most
                common and which storages and notifiers people enable. It is
                just enough to see the overall picture, nothing more.

              <p>The telemetry is deliberately coarse. We never collect:</p>

                <li>
                  <strong>Database, table or column names</strong> - the

              <p>
                These metrics describe trends across all installations, never a

                This helps us decide what to improve first, see which features
                are genuinely useful and spot what is barely used so it can be
                cleaned up. The goal is to keep Databasus as simple and reliable
                as possible.
