Beyond runtime, security and reliability are engineered into every commit and PR: CodeQL static analysis, CodeRabbit with gitleaks and semgrep, Dependabot CVE monitoring, Trivy image and Dockerfile scans, and periodic Codex Security audits from OpenAI. Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB containers and verify full backup-then-restore cycles on every PR. GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs and workflows follow least-privilege permissions. All operations run in containers you control on servers you own, and because it's open source, your security team can audit every line of code before deployment.",

Physical backups are a file-level copy of the entire database cluster — faster to back up and restore for large datasets than logical dumps, and built on PostgreSQL 17's native backup mechanism, so we rely on PostgreSQL's own battle-tested tooling instead of re-inventing it. Full backups are a complete, self-contained copy of the cluster, the base every backup chain starts from. Incremental backups store only what changed since the previous backup, so backups stay small and fast. WAL streaming continuously captures the database write stream, enabling Point-in-time recovery (PITR) for disaster recovery and near-zero data loss. Logical backups are a native dump of the database in its engine-specific binary format, compressed and streamed directly to storage with no intermediate files. All of these backups can run over an SSH tunnel if you have a requirement for non-public connections, so the database never has to be exposed publicly.",

              question="What is Databasus and why should I use it instead of hand-rolled scripts?"
              answer="Databasus is an Apache 2.0 licensed, self-hosted service backing up databases. It differs from shell scripts in that it has a frontend for scheduling tasks, compressing and storing archives on multiple targets (local disk, S3, Google Drive, NAS, Dropbox, SFTP, rclone, etc.), configuring retention policies to automatically prune old backups and notifying your team when tasks finish or fail — all without hand-rolled code"

              question="How do I install Databasus in the quickest manner?"
              answer="Databasus supports multiple installation methods: automated script, Docker, Docker Compose and Kubernetes with Helm. The quickest route is to run the one-line cURL installer, which fetches the current Docker image, creates a docker-compose.yml and boots up the service so it will automatically restart on reboots. For Kubernetes environments, use the official Helm chart for production-ready deployments. Overall time is usually less than two minutes on a typical VPS."

              question="How restore verification works?"
              answer="Databasus runs a small verification agent on a host you control. On every scheduled run the agent downloads the latest backup. It restores the backup into a throwaway database container. Then it sanity-checks the restored database against the source. The result is reported back — including the restore exit code and per-table row counts. Schedules support after backup, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or a UTC cron expression. Failures can be sent through any notifier wired to the database — Slack, Teams, Discord, email and others."

              answer={
                <>
                  Databasus enforces security on three levels: (1) Sensitive
                  data encryption — all passwords, tokens and credentials are
                  encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored separately from the
                  database; (2) Backup encryption — each backup file is
                  encrypted with a unique key derived from a master key, backup
                  ID and random salt, making backups useless without your
                  encryption key even if someone gains storage access; (3)
                  Read-only database access — Databasus only requires SELECT
                  permissions and performs comprehensive checks to ensure no
                  write privileges exist, preventing data corruption even if the
                  tool is compromised.

                  Beyond runtime, security and reliability are engineered into
                  every commit and PR: CodeQL static analysis, CodeRabbit with
                  gitleaks and semgrep, Dependabot CVE monitoring, Trivy image
                  and Dockerfile scans, and periodic Codex Security audits from
                  OpenAI. Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL, MySQL,
                  MariaDB and MongoDB containers and verify full
                  backup-then-restore cycles on every PR. GitHub Actions are
                  pinned to commit SHAs and workflows follow least-privilege

              answer={
                <>
                  To start your very first Databasus backup, simply log in to
                  the dashboard, click on New Backup, select an interval —
                  hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or cron. Then specify the exact
                  run time (e.g., 02:30 for off-peak hours).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Then input your PostgreSQL host, port number, database name,
                  credentials and SSL preference. Choose where the archive
                  should be sent (local path, S3 bucket, Google Drive folder,
                  Dropbox, etc.). <br />
                  <br />
                  If you need, add notification channels such as email, Slack,
                  Telegram or a webhook and click Save. Databasus instantly
                  validates the info, starts the schedule, runs the initial job
                  and sends live status. So you may restore with one touch when
                  the backup is complete.

              answer={
                <>
                  Databasus prefers simplicity — it provides a modern web
                  interface to manage backups for many databases at once,
                  instead of complex configuration files and command-line tools.
                  Unlike raw pg_dump scripts, it includes built-in scheduling,
                  compression, multiple storage destinations, health monitoring
                  and real-time notifications — all managed through a simple web
                  UI.

                  <br />
                  At the same time, unlike pgBackRest and WAL-G, Databasus makes
                  physical, incremental and WAL backups on top of PostgreSQL
                  17&apos;s native approach, so it does not reinvent its own
                  backup engine. It connects to your databases remotely,
                  reaching closed networks through an SSH tunnel to the server
                  or a bastion, so databases that are not publicly exposed can
                  still be backed up and managed from a single dashboard.{" "}

Databasus focuses on disaster recovery with low RTO and RPO, so it is closer to an alternative to pgBackRest or WAL-G — it tries to make disaster recovery as simple as pg_dump. That said, for logical backups it does serve as a pg_dump alternative and uses pg_dump under the hood, adding a user-friendly web interface, automated scheduling, multiple storage destinations, real-time notifications, health monitoring and backup encryption.

                  Databasus supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB.
                  However, Databasus was originally created specifically for
                  PostgreSQL and maintains its primary focus on it — providing
                  100% excellent support and maximum efficiency for PostgreSQL

                  Physical, incremental and WAL backups build on PostgreSQL
                  17&apos;s native mechanism, so they require PostgreSQL 17 or
                  newer; on older versions only logical backups are available.
                  This is intentional: most production databases already run on
                  PostgreSQL 17 or above, and within roughly two years the older
                  versions reach end of life. Databasus aims to become the
                  standard backup tool for databases from PostgreSQL 17 onward.

                  All of these backups can run over an SSH tunnel if you have a
                  requirement for non-public connections, so the database never
                  has to be exposed publicly.

              question="How is AI used in Databasus development?"
              answer={
                <>
                  There have been questions about AI usage in project
                  development. As the project focuses on security, reliability
                  and production usage, we want to be transparent about how AI
                  is used in the development process.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  AI is used as a helper for code quality verification,
                  documentation improvement and assistance during development.
                  AI is NOT used for writing entire code or code without tests.
                  The project has solid test coverage, CI/CD automation and
                  verification by experienced developers.
                  <br />
                  <br />

              question="What is the adoption level of Databasus?"
              answer={
                <>
                  Databasus has over 1 million Docker pulls and 7.5k GitHub
                  stars. For comparison, pgBackRest and WAL-G sit at around 4.2k
                  stars each and Barman at about 3.1k, which makes Databasus the
                  most popular database backup tool on GitHub.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It has been accepted into the open-source programs of
                  Anthropic and OpenAI as an important, critical project. Today
                  Databasus is used by enterprises, teams and DevOps engineers,
                  backed by a large and active community.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Databasus has been developed and used since 2023, and open
                  source in widespread use since early 2025. It has been in real
                  production use for a while, so it is battle-tested across many
                  edge cases. Crucially, Databasus does not invent custom ways to
                  back up your data — it relies on PostgreSQL&apos;s native,
                  tested implementation instead of building its own workarounds
                  for edge cases.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our goal is to become the standard backup tool for PostgreSQL
                  from version 17 and above. Databasus is the first backup tool
                  built on PostgreSQL&apos;s native, efficient and now standard
                  backup protocol instead of writing its own implementations.
