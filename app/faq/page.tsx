Databases in closed networks can be reached through an SSH tunnel. Physical backups use PostgreSQL 17's native stack: full backups via pg_basebackup, block-level incrementals via pg_basebackup --incremental driven by server-side WAL summaries (summarize_wal = on), and continuous WAL streaming via pg_receivewal. Physical backups require PostgreSQL 17 or newer; on older versions you use logical pg_dump backups instead. To restore to a point in time, pg_combinebackup reconstructs a runnable data directory from the full backup and its incremental chain, and PostgreSQL then replays WAL up to the target time you choose, recovering to any second between backups. The Databasus UI gives step-by-step instructions for restoring to a host or a Docker database, either through a ready-made script that makes the restore a single command or by downloading the backups and rebuilding the chain of full, incremental and WAL parts yourself. Incremental and WAL are optional: you can take only a full backup, and WAL is not mandatory.

                  text: "An earlier version of Databasus shipped a backup agent: a binary that ran on the database host to stream WAL and create physical backups locally. That first implementation turned out to be a mistake and has been removed. It was a naive implementation that only copied WAL on top of full backups, which led to a long RTO. Users had to configure both Databasus and a separate agent, when doing everything remotely from one place is far simpler. Because the agent lived outside the main system, it was hard to cover every test case. There is really only one problem an agent solves: reaching a database that is not accessible from outside, and for 99% of users that is already handled by running Databasus inside the private network or connecting over SSH, so the agent was reinventing the wheel and making a simple problem far more complicated than needed. It also could not run on managed databases like RDS and Cloud SQL, which forbid host-level installs but already expose the replication protocol, so a remote path was needed anyway. On top of that it came with a lot of edge cases around broken connections, managing agent updates and gathering logs from a separate process, and the fewer moving parts a system has, the more reliable it is in everyday use. Physical backups now run remotely from the Databasus host. Existing backups stay safe: if you upgrade from a version that still has agent backups, Databasus won't do it silently but warns you about the change and lets you either stay on the supported version 3.42.0 or remove the old agent backups yourself before upgrading. The agent-based implementation remains available up to version 3.42.0 and will keep working for a long time.",

              <p>
                For logical backups, Databasus uses <code>pg_dump</code>&apos;s{" "}
                <strong>custom format</strong> with{" "}
                <strong>zstd compression at level 5</strong> instead of the
                plain SQL format because it provides the most efficient balance
                between:
              </p>

                <li>
                  File size compression (up to 20x times smaller than plain SQL
                  format)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This decision was made after extensive testing and benchmarking
                of different PostgreSQL backup formats and compression methods.

              <p>
                Databasus runs physical backups{" "}
                <strong>remotely from its own host</strong>, connecting to your
                PostgreSQL over the standard{" "}

                installed on the database server. If the database lives in a
                closed network, Databasus can reach it
                through an SSH tunnel to an internal host or a bastion, so the
                database never has to be exposed publicly.

                    <strong>Why this is possible now:</strong> for years tools
                    like pgBackRest and WAL-G had to build their own engines for
                    incremental, block-level backups, because PostgreSQL had no
                    native one. That changed with PostgreSQL 17, where the
                    feature was developed by <strong>Robert Haas</strong> with
                    help from <strong>David Steele</strong>, the author of
                    pgBackRest. PostgreSQL now ships native server-side
                    block-level incremental backups under the hood (
                    <code>pg_basebackup --incremental</code> and{" "}
                    <code>summarize_wal</code>), so Databasus builds on that
                    instead of reinventing one.

              <ul>

                  Full backups are created with <code>pg_basebackup</code>,
                  streamed directly to Databasus
                </li>
                <li>
                  Block-level incrementals use{" "}
                  <code>pg_basebackup --incremental</code>, where PostgreSQL
                  17&apos;s server-side WAL summaries (
                  <code>summarize_wal = on</code>) track changes so only the
                  changed blocks are transferred
                </li>
                <li>
                  WAL is streamed continuously via <code>pg_receivewal</code> to

                  Physical backups require{" "}
                  <strong>PostgreSQL 17 or newer</strong>; on older versions you
                  use logical <code>pg_dump</code> backups instead

                Physical backups now run remotely from the Databasus host, as
                described above.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Why the agent was the wrong approach:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  It was a naive implementation that only copied WAL on top of
                  full backups, which led to a long RTO
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users had to configure both Databasus and a separate agent,
                  when doing everything remotely from one place is far simpler
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because the agent lived outside the main system, it was hard to
                  cover every test case
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is really only one problem an agent solves: reaching a
                  database that is not accessible from outside. For 99% of users
                  that is already handled by running Databasus inside the private
                  network or connecting over SSH, so the agent was reinventing
                  the wheel and making a simple problem far more complicated than
                  it needed to be
                </li>
                <li>
                  It could not run on managed databases like RDS and Cloud SQL,
                  which forbid host-level installs but already expose the
                  replication protocol, so a remote path was needed anyway
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also came with a lot of edge cases. Broken connections,
                  managing agent updates and gathering logs from a separate
                  process were all painful, and the fewer moving parts a system
                  has, the more reliable it is in everyday use
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>We made sure existing backups stay safe.</strong> If you
                upgrade from a version that still has agent backups, Databasus
                won&apos;t do it silently: it warns you about the change and lets
                you either stay on the supported{" "}
                <strong>version 3.42.0</strong> or remove the old agent backups
                yourself before upgrading. The agent-based implementation remains
                available up to version 3.42.0 and will keep working for a long
                time, so nothing breaks.

              <h2 id="ai-usage">How is AI used in Databasus development?</h2>

              <p>
                There have been questions about AI usage in project development
                in issues and discussions. As the project focuses on security,
                reliability and production usage, it&apos;s important to explain
                how AI is used in the development process.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is used as a helper for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Verification of code quality and searching for vulnerabilities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cleaning up and improving documentation, comments and code
                </li>
                <li>Assistance during development</li>
                <li>Double-checking PRs and commits after human review</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is NOT used for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Writing entire code</li>
                <li>&quot;Vibe code&quot; approach</li>
                <li>Code without line-by-line verification by a human</li>
                <li>Code without tests</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>The project has:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Solid test coverage (both unit and integration tests)</li>
                <li>
                  CI/CD pipeline automation with tests and linting to ensure
                  code quality
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verification by experienced developers with experience in
                  large and secure projects
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                So AI is just an assistant and a tool for developers to increase
                productivity and ensure code quality. The work is done by
                developers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, it&apos;s important to note that we do not
                differentiate between bad human code and AI vibe code. There are
                strict requirements for any code to be merged to keep the
                codebase maintainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even if code is written manually by a human, it&apos;s not
                guaranteed to be merged. Vibe code is not allowed at all and all
                such PRs are rejected by default (see{" "}

              <p>
                If you want to backup your Databasus instance (including all
                configurations, databases and credentials), follow these steps:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Go to <code>/opt/databasus</code> (or the folder where you
                  installed Databasus)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Navigate to the <code>databasus-data</code> directory
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                <strong>You need to backup:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>secret.key</code> — encryption key for your credentials
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>/pgdata</code> — internal PostgreSQL database of
                  Databasus that contains all your configurations and backup
                  metadata
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you use local storage for backups, you can also backup the{" "}
                <code>backups</code> folder.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> There are two different scenarios
                for recovery:
              </p>

                  recover your database backups using only the{" "}
                  <code>secret.key</code> file, without needing Databasus or its
                  internal data. See the{" "}

                  <strong>Restore Databasus UI and all configurations:</strong>{" "}
                  If you want to restore the Databasus interface with all your
                  configurations, scheduled backups and backup history, you need
                  to backup both <code>secret.key</code> and the{" "}
                  <code>/pgdata</code> folder (which contains the encryption
                  metadata and all Databasus configurations).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>To restore Databasus on another server:</strong> simply
                recreate the <code>databasus-data</code> folder structure with
                the backed up files and start Databasus.
