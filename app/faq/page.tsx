              <p>
                Databasus uses the <code>pg_dump</code>&apos;s{" "}
                <strong>custom format</strong> with{" "}
                <strong>zstd compression at level 5</strong> instead of the
                plain SQL format because it provides the most efficient balance
                between:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Backup creation speed</li>
                <li>Restore speed</li>
                <li>
                  File size compression (up to 20x times smaller than plain SQL
                  format)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This decision was made after extensive testing and benchmarking
                of different PostgreSQL backup formats and compression methods.

              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus intentionally focuses on logical backups rather than
                PITR for several practical reasons:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Complex setup requirements</strong> — PITR tools
                  typically need to be installed on the same server as your
                  database, requiring direct filesystem access and careful
                  configuration
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Restoration limitations</strong> — incremental backups
                  cannot be restored without direct access to the database
                  storage drive
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloud incompatibility</strong> — managed cloud
                  databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure) don&apos;t allow
                  restoring external PITR backups, making them useless for
                  cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Built-in cloud PITR</strong> — cloud providers already
                  offer native PITR capabilities and even they typically default
                  to hourly or daily granularity
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Practical sufficiency</strong> — for 99% of projects,
                  hourly or daily logical backups provide adequate recovery
                  points without the operational complexity of WAL archiving
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                So instead of second-by-second restoration complexity, Databasus
                prioritizes an intuitive UX for individuals and teams, making it
                the most reliable tool for managing multiple databases and day
                to day use.
              </p>

              <h2 id="ai-usage">How is AI used in Databasus development?</h2>

              <p>
                There have been questions about AI usage in project development
                in issues and discussions. As the project focuses on security,
                reliability and production usage, it&apos;s important to explain
                how AI is used in the development process.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is used as a helper for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Verification of code quality and searching for vulnerabilities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cleaning up and improving documentation, comments and code
                </li>
                <li>Assistance during development</li>
                <li>Double-checking PRs and commits after human review</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is NOT used for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Writing entire code</li>
                <li>&quot;Vibe code&quot; approach</li>
                <li>Code without line-by-line verification by a human</li>
                <li>Code without tests</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>The project has:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Solid test coverage (both unit and integration tests)</li>
                <li>
                  CI/CD pipeline automation with tests and linting to ensure
                  code quality
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verification by experienced developers with experience in
                  large and secure projects
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                So AI is just an assistant and a tool for developers to increase
                productivity and ensure code quality. The work is done by
                developers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, it&apos;s important to note that we do not
                differentiate between bad human code and AI vibe code. There are
                strict requirements for any code to be merged to keep the
                codebase maintainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even if code is written manually by a human, it&apos;s not
                guaranteed to be merged. Vibe code is not allowed at all and all
                such PRs are rejected by default (see{" "}
                <a href="/contribute">contributing guide</a>).
              </p>

              <p>
                We also draw attention to fast issue resolution and security{" "}

              <p>
                If you want to backup your Databasus instance (including all
                configurations, databases and credentials), follow these steps:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Go to <code>/opt/databasus</code> (or the folder where you
                  installed Databasus)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Navigate to the <code>databasus-data</code> directory
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                <strong>You need to backup:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>secret.key</code> — encryption key for your credentials
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>/pgdata</code> — internal PostgreSQL database of
                  Databasus that contains all your configurations and backup
                  metadata
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you use local storage for backups, you can also backup the{" "}
                <code>backups</code> folder.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> There are two different scenarios
                for recovery:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Recover backups without Databasus UI:</strong> You can
                  recover your database backups using only the{" "}
                  <code>secret.key</code> file, without needing Databasus or its
                  internal data. See the{" "}

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Restore Databasus UI and all configurations:</strong>{" "}
                  If you want to restore the Databasus interface with all your
                  configurations, scheduled backups and backup history, you need
                  to backup both <code>secret.key</code> and the{" "}
                  <code>/pgdata</code> folder (which contains the encryption
                  metadata and all Databasus configurations).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>To restore Databasus on another server:</strong> simply
                recreate the <code>databasus-data</code> folder structure with
                the backed up files and start Databasus.

                by OpenAI. It is really valuable for us that the project has
                been recognized as important open-source software for the
                industry by two of the world&apos;s leading AI companies —
                especially given the high eligibility requirements of both
                programs.
              </p>

              <p>
                What does it mean for users? It just one more reliability
                confirmation that the project has been independently evaluated
                and recognized by industry leaders as critical infrastructure
                worth supporting. So we have even higher code quality, faster
                security reviews and continued active development due to access
                to the latest unlimited AIs.

                Despite having access to these programs, Databasus maintains
                strict AI usage rules as described in the{" "}
                <a href="#ai-usage">AI usage section</a>. All code requires
                line-by-line human verification, full test coverage and
                experienced developer review. Vibe coding is not allowed. AI
                remains a tool for developers — not a replacement for human
                judgment.

                Why are PostgreSQL and Valkey packaged inside the container?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus uses PostgreSQL as its internal storage (backup
                metadata, database configurations, audit logs, etc.) and Valkey
                for caching. Both are bundled inside the image. Here is why:
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>For users:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>You only pull one image</strong> — no extra configs,
                  no managing other images, no tracking internal service
                  versions, no environment variables to set. Just run{" "}
                  <code>docker run</code>, even if you manage hundreds of
                  databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Auto-update covers everything</strong> — enable
                  auto-update for the Databasus image and forget about it. There
                  are no separate upgrade guides for internal services and no
                  multiple image versions to keep in sync.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    The <a href="/faq#backup-databasus">backup guide</a> just
                    works
                  </strong>{" "}
                  — it is written around the internal PostgreSQL. With an
                  external database you would have to figure out its backup
                  separately.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>For Databasus maintainers:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>We know exactly what is inside the image</strong> — we
                  control migrations, extensions and service configuration. That
                  means we can safely bump internal service versions without
                  breaking compatibility and stay focused on development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Users never have to touch their compose files for upgrades
                  </strong>{" "}
                  — PostgreSQL and Valkey versions are updated inside the image.
                  With external services, many users would skip or delay upgrade
                  steps and run into compatibility issues across versions.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                So, summing up, it is reasonable approach for projects which
                focus on simple UX and do not face hunders of RPS. For example,
                GitLab CE follows same approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What about performance overhead?</strong> — there is
                none worth noting. Databasus is network-intensive (uploading and
                downloading backup files to remote storage), not
                database-intensive. The internal PostgreSQL typically use
                100–150 MB of RAM for hundreds of backup jobs across hundreds of
                databases with millions of backups records. If you increase your
                server resources, it will increase accordingly so there is no
                chance to reach vertical scaling limits.
                <br />
                <br />
                Both services are only accessible inside the container
                (PostgreSQL runs on port <code>5437</code>, Valkey binds to{" "}
                <code>127.0.0.1</code> only) and are never exposed externally.

                    This is not a tested or supported configuration.
                  </strong>{" "}
                  We do not run migration tests against external services, so
                  your instance may break on the next upgrade with no migration
                  path provided. If you understand the risks — the variables are
                  below.

              </div>

              <p>
                The only reason we use external services ourselves is the
                Databasus playground — it runs on a cluster of distributed
                servers that together handle up to 100 Gbit/s of throughput, so
                all nodes need to share the same database.
                <br />
                <br />
                Why do we use a multi-node cluster for the playground, but not
                recommend it to you even you have hundreds of DBs? Our
                playground is a public service used by thousands of users
                (because Databasus is the most popular PostgreSQL backup tool
                now). Because it is public, we also face DDoS attacks and need
                far higher throughput than any typical company would. It&apos;s
                not just production use, it&apos;s permanent defence 🛡️. You are
                almost certainly not running anything like this.
                <br />
                <br />
                Actually, we don&apos;t know which company needs to backup
                thousands of DBs like our playground. Usual production use of
                Databasus is from a couple of databases to hundreds of databases
                (in DBA outsourcing companies)
                <br />
                <br />
                Anyway, if you genuinely face the same situation as we — use
                variables below (we do not lock this ability despite it&apos;s
                hard to maintain it), but lock Databasus version before. By the
                way, for a regular single-server installation this adds
                complexity with no benefit. For internal backuping of our DBs we
                also use regular Databasus installation with internal PostgreSQL
                and Valkey.

                If you still want to proceed, here are the environment variables
                that control this:

                <li>
                  <code>VALKEY_PASSWORD</code> — password

                <li>
                  <code>VALKEY_IS_SSL</code> — <code>true</code> or{" "}

              </ul>

              <h3 id="distributed-ha">
                What if I need distributed stateless HA?
              </h3>

              <p>
                If your goal is a fully distributed, stateless HA setup where
                multiple application nodes share the same PostgreSQL and Valkey
                instances — neither Databasus, WAL-G, nor pgBackRest are the
                right tools for that. Those are backup tools, not cluster
                orchestrators.
              </p>

              <p>
                For distributed PostgreSQL HA you should look at purpose-built
                Kubernetes operators:
