              <p>
                For logical backups, Databasus uses{" "}
                <code>pg_dump</code>&apos;s{" "}
                <strong>custom format</strong> with{" "}
                <strong>zstd compression at level 5</strong> instead of the
                plain SQL format because it provides the most efficient balance

                <li>
                  File size compression (up to 20x times smaller than plain SQL

              </ul>

              <p>
                This decision was made after extensive testing and benchmarking

              <p>
                Databasus supports PITR through the{" "}
                <strong>Databasus agent</strong> — a lightweight Go binary that
                runs alongside your PostgreSQL database. The agent connects
                outbound to your Databasus instance, so the database never

              <ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                  WAL segments are compressed with zstd and continuously
                  uploaded to Databasus with gap detection to ensure chain
                  integrity
                </li>
                <li>
                  Physical backups are created via{" "}
                  <code>pg_basebackup</code>, streamed as compressed TAR
                  directly to Databasus — no intermediate files on disk
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full backups are triggered on schedule or automatically when
                  the WAL chain is broken
                </li>

                <li>
                  It extracts the basebackup, configures PostgreSQL recovery

              <p>
                There have been questions about AI usage in project development
                in issues and discussions. As the project focuses on security,
                reliability and production usage, it&apos;s important to explain
                how AI is used in the development process.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is used as a helper for:</strong>

                <li>Code without tests</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>The project has:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>

              <p>
                So AI is just an assistant and a tool for developers to increase
                productivity and ensure code quality. The work is done by
                developers.
              </p>

                Moreover, it&apos;s important to note that we do not
                differentiate between bad human code and AI vibe code. There are
                strict requirements for any code to be merged to keep the
                codebase maintainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even if code is written manually by a human, it&apos;s not
                guaranteed to be merged. Vibe code is not allowed at all and all

                If you want to backup your Databasus instance (including all

              </p>

              <ol>

                  Go to <code>/opt/databasus</code> (or the folder where you
                  installed Databasus)

                <li>
                  Navigate to the <code>databasus-data</code> directory

                  If you want to restore the Databasus interface with all your
                  configurations, scheduled backups and backup history, you need
                  to backup both <code>secret.key</code> and the{" "}
                  <code>/pgdata</code> folder (which contains the encryption
                  metadata and all Databasus configurations).

              <p>
                <strong>To restore Databasus on another server:</strong> simply
                recreate the <code>databasus-data</code> folder structure with
                the backed up files and start Databasus.

                been recognized as important open-source software for the
                industry by two of the world&apos;s leading AI companies —

                What does it mean for users? It just one more reliability
                confirmation that the project has been independently evaluated
                and recognized by industry leaders as critical infrastructure
                worth supporting. So we have even higher code quality, faster
                security reviews and continued active development due to access
                to the latest unlimited AIs.

                Despite having access to these programs, Databasus maintains
                strict AI usage rules as described in the{" "}
                <a href="#ai-usage">AI usage section</a>. All code requires
                line-by-line human verification, full test coverage and
                experienced developer review. Vibe coding is not allowed. AI
                remains a tool for developers — not a replacement for human
                judgment.
