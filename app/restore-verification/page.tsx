                A backup that finishes without error is not the same as a backup
                you can actually restore. The only real proof is to restore it.
                Databasus does this for you on a schedule:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>takes the latest backup</li>
                <li>runs restore into a throwaway database container</li>
                <li>sanity-checks the restored database against the source</li>
                <li>tears the container down</li>
                <li>reports the outcome</li>

                What is a verification agent?
              </h2>

              <p>
                The verification agent is a small Go binary you run on a machine
                you control — anything with spare CPU, RAM and disk works. The
                agent registers with Databasus, picks up verification jobs from
                a queue, runs them locally and reports results back.
              </p>

              <h3 id="what-you-need">What you need</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A host with outbound HTTPS access to your Databasus URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Docker available on that host — the agent spins up ephemeral
                  database containers of the matching major version for each
                  job.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disk capacity of roughly{" "}
                  <strong>2× your largest backup</strong> with at least 1 GB of
                  headroom. A single job needs space for the compressed archive
                  and the restored database side by side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At least 1 CPU core and 512 MB of RAM available per concurrent
                  job.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="why-not-just-checksums">Why not just checksums?</h3>

              <p>
                Checksums and exit codes catch some failure modes but miss
                others entirely:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Checksums</strong> catch bit rot on the archive file,
                  but say nothing about whether the dump itself is complete or
                  semantically valid.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dump exit code</strong> says the dump command ran. It
                  does not catch a role missing read permissions on certain
                  objects, a missing extension on the source or a tablespace
                  mismatch — all of which can cause objects to be silently
                  skipped or stripped.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Restore verification</strong> actually runs the
                  archive through the database&apos;s native restore tool and
                  counts rows per table. It is the only check that catches all
                  of the above — if a backup will not restore, you find out
                  before you need it, not during a disaster.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="create-on-ui">Create an agent in the UI</h3>

              <p>
                Open <strong>Settings → Verification agents</strong> and click{" "}
                <strong>Create verification agent</strong>. Pick a descriptive
                name like <code>staging-verifier</code> or{" "}
                <code>eu-west-host-1</code>. The next dialog shows the
                agent&apos;s <strong>token</strong> and <strong>ID</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The token is shown <strong>exactly once</strong> — copy it
                before closing the dialog. If you lose it later, use the{" "}
                <strong>Rotate token</strong> action on the agent&apos;s row to
                issue a new one; the old token stops working on the agent&apos;s
                next heartbeat. The dialog that follows shows the install
                commands for your server&apos;s architecture — the same commands
                described below.
              </p>

              <p>
                SSH into the machine that will run verifications. First,
                download the agent binary. Replace{" "}
                <code>https://your-databasus-host</code> with your own Databasus
                URL, and swap <code>amd64</code> for <code>arm64</code> if your
                server is ARM:
              </p>

              <div className="relative my-6">

              </div>

              <p>
                Then launch the agent. The agent ID and token come from the
                dialog in the previous step:
              </p>

                    The Databasus host must be <code>https://</code>. Plain HTTP
                    is only allowed if you add{" "}
                    <code>--allow-insecure-http</code>, and it is intended for

                The four <code>--max-*</code> flags are <strong>budgets</strong>
                , not per-job allocations. The agent reports them to Databasus
                on every heartbeat, and Databasus divides them across the
                concurrent jobs you allow. With{" "}
                <code>

                the single job gets all 2 CPUs and 2 GB of RAM. With{" "}
                <code>--max-concurrent-jobs=2</code>, each job gets 1 CPU and 1
                GB. The floor is 1 CPU and 512 MB per job — if your budget
                can&apos;t satisfy that floor, the agent advertises lower
                concurrency. The disk budget is the easiest to get wrong: it
                needs to cover the compressed archive <em>and</em> the restored
                database side by side, so set <code>--max-disk-gb</code> to
                roughly twice the size of your largest backup with at least 1 GB
                of headroom.

              <h3 id="manage">Manage the agent</h3>

              <p>The same binary provides four subcommands:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>./verification-agent status</code> — show whether the
                  daemon is running and what jobs it is currently working on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>./verification-agent stop</code> — stop the daemon.
                  In-flight verifications are reported back to Databasus as
                  failed and are re-queued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>./verification-agent start</code> — re-launch the
                  daemon. Flags are remembered from the first start; pass{" "}
                  <code>--token=&lt;NEW&gt;</code> after a rotation to update
                  the stored token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>./verification-agent run</code> — run in the foreground
                  instead of as a daemon. Use this when wrapping the agent in a
                  systemd unit or a Docker container — those supervisors expect
                  the process not to fork off.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The Settings page shows three icon actions on each agent&apos;s
                row: view the install commands again (without revealing the
                token), rotate the token, and delete the agent. Deleting is safe
                — any verifications currently assigned to that agent are
                returned to the queue and picked up by another agent if one is
                available.

                A verification is usually slower than the backup that produced

                — only the most recent backup waits in line. The trade-off is
                intentional: it is better to skip a verification of a stale
                backup than to spend hours verifying something you&apos;d never
                restore from anyway.

                You can also kick off a one-off verification from the
                database&apos;s <strong>Restore verifications</strong> tab
                without changing the schedule. Useful for spot-checking a
                specific backup or smoke-testing a new agent end-to-end before
                you trust it with the scheduled load.

                Success and failure can be sent through any notifier already
                wired up for the database. The two checkboxes —{" "}
                <strong>Verification success</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>Verification failed</strong> — are independent. Most
                teams enable only the failure one to avoid notification fatigue.

                Each verification attempt shows up as one row in the
                database&apos;s <strong>Restore verifications</strong> tab. The
                status is one of <strong>Pending</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>Running</strong>, <strong>Successful</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>Failed</strong> or <strong>Canceled</strong>. Clicking a
                row opens a drawer with the full timeline, the{" "}
                restore exit code, the restored database size,
                schema and table counts, and a per-table row-count breakdown.
                Failed runs show the failure message at the top of the drawer.
