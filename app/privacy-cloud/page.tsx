              <h3 id="account-data">Account data</h3>

              <p>
                When you create an account we collect the following information:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Name</strong> — to identify you in the dashboard and
                  for communication
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication,
                  transactional notifications (backup status, account-related
                  updates) and support
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Password</strong> — if you register with
                  email/password, your password is securely hashed and never
                  stored in plain text
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                You may also sign up or log in via third-party OAuth providers
                (GitHub, Google). In that case, we receive only your name and
                email from the provider. We do not access any other data from
                your GitHub or Google account.
              </p>

              <h3 id="database-credentials">Database credentials</h3>

              <p>
                To perform backups, you provide connection details for your
                databases (host, port, database name, username, password). All
                credentials are encrypted. We access your database only to
                perform backups via standard dump tools (pg_dump, mysqldump,
                mongodump) with the minimum permissions required by each tool.
                We do not manually inspect your database content — access is
                limited to automated backup operations.
              </p>

              <h3 id="backup-data">Backup data</h3>

              <p>
                Backup archives are stored in S3-compatible storage in the EU
                and USA. Each backup file is encrypted with a unique key derived
                from a master key, backup ID and random salt. We do not access
                the contents of your backups unless required by law or with your
                explicit consent for support purposes.
              </p>

              <h3 id="audit-logs">Audit logs</h3>

              <p>
                Databasus Cloud records audit logs of actions performed within
                your organization (backup downloads, schedule changes,
                configuration updates, user access, etc.). These logs are stored
                on our servers. Users within your organization can view them
                through the dashboard. We may access audit logs for support and
                debugging purposes.
