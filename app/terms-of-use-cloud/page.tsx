              <p>
                Databasus Cloud is a managed cloud service for automated
                database backups. The Service supports PostgreSQL, MySQL,
                MariaDB and MongoDB. It provides scheduled backups, encrypted
                storage, backup management, team access controls and audit
                logging. The Service uses standard database dump tools (pg_dump,
                mysqldump, mongodump) to create backups and stores them in
                encrypted form in S3-compatible storage.
              </p>
